# enviroCar.github.io

GitHub organization page for the [enviroCar project](http://www.envirocar.org). The organization page is used for description of the open source software created in the enviroCar project, and for hosting example or development files that must be downloaded publicly.

## Landing page

This website ``index.html`` is a landing page for developers interested in the enviroCar project. It contains links to the repositories and relevant developer documentation for enviroCar related software projects.

## Files

This repository can also be used to host text files that should be available for public download. However, do *not* use this repo for hosting large binary files, use an attachment in the wiki instead.

### Examples

* `leaderboards.json` is a development file to support the development of a new leaderboard view in the app.
* `user-statistics.json` is a development file to support the development of a new statistics view in the app.
